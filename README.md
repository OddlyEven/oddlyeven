# Oddlyeven

üñêÔ∏è  Hiya,

<p>
  I'm a software :neckbeard: guy specializing in a broad range of languages and technologies.
</p>
<p>
  I started tinkering as a kid when my old man, a former :artificial_satellite: orbital enginner for :satellite: NASA, gave me his Vic-20.
</p>
<p>
  In 1996, I started my professional career using Visual Basic 4.0, Crystal Reports and MS Access.
</p>
<p>
  Today, my skill set spans an array of technologies anywhere from legacy systems to the latest and greatest.
</p>
