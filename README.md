🖐️  Hiya,

I'm a software :neckbeard: guy specializing in a broad range of languages and technologies from Visual Basic 4 to C#/.Net 6.0; from ASP to Angular 13; from desktop to mobile.
I started tinkering as a kid when my old man, a former orbital enginner for NASA, gave me his 👾 Vic-20.
You can see a comprehensive list of my experience on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanstreetmcp/).
