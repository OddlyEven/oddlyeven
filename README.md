🖐️  Hiya,

<p>I'm a software :neckbeard: guy specializing in a broad range of languages and technologies from Visual Basic 4 to C#/.Net 6.0; from ASP to Angular 13; from desktop to mobile.</p>
<p>I started tinkering as a kid when my old man, a former orbital enginner for NASA, gave me his 👾 Vic-20.</p>
